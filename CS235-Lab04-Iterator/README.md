### Lab 4: Iterator

This lab built off of the Linked List lab to include an iterator to iterate through the list. This allows us to not only access the head/tail pointers, but anywhere in the list. For example, you could search for specific data in the list, add/remove in the middle of the list, replace items in the list, etc.
