## Lab 3: Linked List
This one was actually pretty fun, we learned how to use a struct node to create a list of nodes, with pointers to each other. 

The extra credit came from not just having a next pointer, but also having a prev pointer so you could traverse the list in two directions, and also having a tail pointer at the end of the list. It wasn't all that difficult to implement,
