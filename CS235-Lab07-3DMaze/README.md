### Lab 7: 3D Maze

I had a love-hate relationship with this lab. Though I learned a lot, I didn't particularly enjoy it. A lot of the concepts were just barely scraped over in class, and it took a lot of personal research to get it to work right. The order of traversal and recursion was very important, because even if you got a correct solution, if it wasn't the one that the grader was testing for, you lost points as if it didn't work at all.
