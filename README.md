# BYU CS 235
BYU CS 235 Data Structure Labs
Throughout this semester we learned about different C++ Data Structures, how they work, and programmed these data structures ourselves from scratch, including Stacks, Queues, Vectors, Linked Lists, Sets, Maps, Trees, etc. We also learned about some sorting algorithms, and recursion.

### **Lab 1: Grades**
> "Write a program that reads from an input file a person's name followed by all their exam scores. Calculate and write the average score for all students on each exam to an output file. Then, write each student's name to the output file followed by the student's score and grade on each exam." <br />

### **Lab 2: SNAP**
> "Class design is type design. Defining effective classes can be challenging. For this lab you are to design classes for a school database with has-a and is-a relationships that have natural syntax, intuitive semantics, and efficient memory allocation. The class objects are populated from parsed input strings. Use object inheritance, polymorphism, and function and operator overloading where needed. All member data and internal functions are private. All classes have a "toString" method with friends for the insertion ("<<") operator." <br />

### **Lab 3: LinkedList**
> "Linked lists are a common data structure in all object-oriented languages and will play a vital role in your activities as a programmer. A forward linked list is a singly linked list of node objects containing a value and a pointer to the next node. Only a head or first node pointer is maintained by the list. All list accesses begin with the head pointer. Forward linked lists are a useful containers for insertion and deletion operations in constant time." <br />

### **Lab 4: Iterator**
> - "The concept of an iterator is fundamental to understanding the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). Iterators provide access to data stored in container classes (e.g. vector, map, list, deque, etc.)"
> - "Add a nested iterator class to your linked list to sequentially access list elements. Your iterator supports begin() and end() functions along with overloaded not equal ("!="), dereferencing ("*"), and pre-incrementing ("++") operators."
> - "Use the list iterator to iterate, find, insert after, replace, and erase elements in the linked list." <br />

### **Lab 5: Expressions**
> "In computer science, the shunting-yard algorithm is a method for parsing an infix mathematical expression to either a postfix notation expression (also known as Reverse Polish notation), or an abstract syntax tree. A similar algorithm produces a prefix expression (known as Polish notation). The algorithm was invented by Edsger Dijkstra and is named the 'shunting yard' algorithm because its operation resembles that of a rail road shunting yard." <br />

### **Lab 6: Railroad**
> "Create a railroad train station that uses a central turntable and roundhouses to store and order train cars. Cars enter the train station if the turntable is empty. From the turntable cars can be moved to a "stack" roundhouse facility (LIFO) or a "queue" roundhouse facility (FIFO). Train cars exit the train station by moving from the turntable to a "vector" of outbound cars." <br />

### **Lab 7: 3D Maze**
> "Two SCUBA diving buddies have encountered a large, box-shaped storage facility inside the hull of the Heian Maru, a 512' submarine tender lying on the bottom of Truk Lagoon at 108'. The storage facility is composed of cells, some of which can be entered and some which cannot. The only exterior walls that are missing are on the front of the storage facility in the upper left corner, and on the rear of the storage facility in the lower right corner. The divers wish to determine a path through the storage facility. Use recursion to find a path through the maze or to prove that there is no path." <br />

### **Lab 8: BST (Binary Search Tree)**
> - "A binary search tree (BST), which may sometimes be called an ordered or sorted binary tree, is a node-based data structure where each node references a value, a left child, and a right child."
> - "In a Binary Search Tree, the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value, the right subtree of a node contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value, there are no duplicate nodes, and both left and right subtrees of a node must also be binary search trees." <br />

### **Lab 9: Pokemon (Maps and Sets)**
> "Welcome to the world of Pokémon! In this world, you can use special creatures to battle against each other, and the trainer with the best strategy wins. In this lab you will implement a set and a map and then use them to create a Pokémon storage and battle system." <br />
> https://students.cs.byu.edu/~cs235ta/labs/L09-Maps_Sets/maps_sets.php

### **Lab 10: QuickSort**
> "Quicksort is a sorting algorithm developed by Tony Hoare that, on average, makes O(n log n) comparisons to sort n items. It is also known as partition-exchange sort. In the worst case, it makes O(n^2) comparisons, though this behavior is rare. Quicksort is typically faster in practice than other O(n log n) algorithms. Additionally, quicksort's sequential and localized memory references work well with a cache. Quicksort can be implemented as an in-place partitioning algorithm." <br />

### **Lab 11: AVL Tree** _(Extra Credit)_
> "In computer science, an AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree, and it was the first such data structure to be invented. In an AVL tree, the heights of the two subtrees of any node differ by at most one. Lookup, insertion, and deletion all take O(log n) time in both the average and worst cases, where n is the number of nodes in the tree prior to the operation. Insertions and deletions may require the tree to be rebalanced by one or more tree rotations." <br />
