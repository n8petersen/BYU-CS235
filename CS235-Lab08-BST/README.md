### Lab 8: BST (Binary Search Tree)

This lab wasn't particularly difficult, as there are are many examples and visualizations readily available for this concept. The hardest part was definitely the removal process, as you had to move nodes around to their correct locations after the target node is deleted. I kind of liked this lab though, it took a lot of fun problem solving.

Extra credit came from adding a tree command that just displays the contents in order using an iterator. It wasn't difficult to add and didn't take too long, but I started at 11pm the night it was due and finished at 12:30, so I only got half the extra credit, but it was well worth it.
