## Lab 6: Railroad

This is another lab I actually enjoyed doing, it really help to understand the difference between the different containers (stack, queue, vector) by firstly writing a deque, with all the functionality of the different containers, and then using wrapper functions to actually define how to implement the functionality for the different containers. 

Unforunately one of my peer-reviewers had a real stick up his rectal cavity, and he gave me a poor score for things that we weren't even graded on, and are in fact pretty standard in the industry. I didn't care to arbitrate it though.
