### Lab 9: Pokemon

This lab was just awful. It was very confusing from the get-go, and none of it was clear. It felt like the lab page, the textbook, and the professor were all at odds with one another, and there was no middle remedy. The hashing took me just as long as the rest of the lab combined. Once you had the hashing done to put things in the container in the right location, the rest wasn't very difficult, but I spent hours ripping my hair out trying to figure out why my program wasn't putting things in the right location.

In the end when I really had no clue why it wasn't working correctly, I said "screw it" and just submitted it anyway to see how many points I was going to get as is and behold - there were no problems with my code, but with the example output. It was hashing just fine, they just had it wrong on the example. I had spent nearly two hours on a hashing bug, when there was no bug at all. Thanks Professor + TA's.

I don't even remember what that peer-reviewer said I did wrong, but I remember it was stupid. It was probably the same kid who reviewed my railroad lab.
